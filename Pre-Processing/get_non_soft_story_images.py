# This script takes addresses from a csv file and gets the
# associated street view image and displays it for the user.
# If the user presses 'y', the image is stored in the specified path
# in the folder "non_soft_story"; if the user presses 'u' the image
# is stored in the folder "bad_images"

# the image is saved as "row.jpg", where row is the row number
# from the csv file

# When running the script, include the google api as the first argument
